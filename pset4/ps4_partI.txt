1: Replication

Voting:

    1. update 6 copies, read 3 copies
       n=7
       w=6
       r = 3 (> 1)  
       x > 7/2 > 3; x = 6
       s > 7 - 6; s > 1

       this scheme would work not because to write, it needs exclusive lock on 6
       copies, and in order to read, it needs a shared lock on at least 2. There
       are 7 copies, 6+2>7, so it doesn't work.

    2. update 2 copies, read 6 copies
       n = 7
       w = 2
       r = 6 (> 5)
       x = 2 (!> 3)

       This scheme will not work because fully distributed locking requires
       exclusive lock on more than 3, but this scheme only tries to write to 2

    3. update 5 copies, read 2 copies
       n = 7
       w = 5
       r = 2 (!> 2)

       This scheme will not work because it reads 2, but needs to read at least
       3 for voting.

    4. update 4 copies, read 4 copies
       n = 7
       w = 4
       r = 4 (> 3)
       x = 4 (> 7/2 > 3)
       s = 4 (> 7 - 4 > 3)

       This scheme works because all of the read/write requirements for voting
       and shared/exclusive lock requirements for fully distributed locking are
       met.

2: Grad-credit problem: distributed locking with update locks
    When writing X number of copies, put X number of exclusive locks.  If the
    number of read copies is more than N - X, put update locks on the overlap
    (i.e. 7 copies, 5 write, 3 read. 7 - 5 = 2.  Put shared locks on 1, and
    update lock on 1). That way, the scheme can read 3, and then upgrade 1 from
    update to exclusive (plus exclusive locks on the remaining 4 unlocked
    copies) to get the 5 exclusive locks needed for global XL.
